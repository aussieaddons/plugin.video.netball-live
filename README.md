#Netball Live addon for Kodi

## This add-on supports the free Live Pass offer for eligible Telstra customers. In-app subscriptions through the App Store/Google Play are NOT supported.

##Requirements

Kodi v17 is the minimum recommended version. If you are having SSL errors, upgrading Kodi should solve them. On some platforms earlier versions will work fine.

You will need a Telstra ID account with an eligible service attached to use this add-on. Most Telstra Mobile customers are eligible for a free subscription with their plan. Please see their [website](https://www.telstra.com.au/tv-movies-music/sports-offer) for details.

##How to install

Netball Live is available from the Catch Up TV AU repository located [here](https://github.com/xbmc-catchuptv-au/repo). Head on over and follow the instructions to install the repo, then install the add-on. 

##Settings

You will need to enter your Telstra ID username and password to view videos.

The live streaming bitrates reflect an average bitrate only, you should ideally have twice the bandwidth available to ensure buffer free viewing.

##Issues

Please let me know of any errors by opening an [issue](https://github.com/glennguy/plugin.video.netball-live/issues) ticket. It would be great if you could attach a Kodi debug log file as well. Follow this [guide](http://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file/Easy).
